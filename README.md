# Convert node express based service from from javascript to typescript

Shows a simple http server powered by express with a few routes and tests. `Master` contains the typescript version and `js-version` contains its pure javascript equivilent.

Both versions can be ran by running `yarn` followed by `yarn start`

If you want to fully compile the typescript version to a production-ready javascript build you can run `yarn build` to build it into the "lib" directory and `start:precompiled` to run this built version.
